# Backend for LimboSecure

This is project is made for LimboSecure. Our open-sourced 2FA Plugin.
<br>
This is my first ever JavaScript project, if you think the design is not good, it probably is not.
<br>
Feel free to contribute to the project.
<br>
By default, LimboSecure does not allow server owners to host their own bot due to security issues.
<br>
Using this backend, we created our own discord bot. Check our wiki for more information.
<br>
This is also implemented to the plugin.
<br>
Please note that no support will be provided for this project. (e.g. building, using, implementing)
